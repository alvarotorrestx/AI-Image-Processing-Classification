# AI Image Processing and Classification Project

This project is designed to give you hands-on experience working with an image classifier and enhancing your programming skills using AI assistance. The project has three parts, each focused on different aspects of image classification and processing. By the end, you'll have explored fundamental concepts like Grad-CAM, image occlusion, and creative image filtering.

### Occlusions Analysis


**Screenshot:**


**Observation:**
- Compare the classifier's performance on the original image vs. the occluded versions.

**Answer the following questions:**
- Did the classifier struggle to classify the occluded images?


- Which occlusion had the greatest impact on performance?
